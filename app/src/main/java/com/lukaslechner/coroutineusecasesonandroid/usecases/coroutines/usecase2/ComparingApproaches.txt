Callbacks Approaches:
    - Error Handling is very cumbersome.
    - Code is not in readable format due to too many nested callbacks.
    - Callbacks are executed on main thread as per retrofit documentation.

Rx Java Approach:
    - Less Code return.
    - Better Error Handling.
    - Disposable needs to be used to free up resources used.

Coroutines Approach:
    - Code is Concise.
    - lifecycle management is built in, as soon as view model is destroyed scope gets canceled.
    - retrofit calls are main thread safe.
